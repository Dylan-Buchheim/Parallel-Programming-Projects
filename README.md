# Parallel-Programming-Projects
 A repository containing the project files for my parallel computing coursework.
 
 The projects consisted mainly of implementing various mathematical algoritms, such as Gaussian Elimination, using parallel computing. The projects were written in C and utilize pthread and OpenMP for the parallel computation. All programs were compiled and run on the Quanah cluster located at the Texas Tech High Performance Computing Center.
